# Into the Metaverse

## Reverse Engineering -- 450 points

### Description

We extracted the DRM module from a target device but haven't been able to reverse engineer its validation logic. See what you can do: [metaverse](./metaverse)

### Hints

* Have you heard of 'virtualization obfuscation'?
* The custom VM architecture is based on a 'stack machine cpu'
* Debugging a virtualized obfuscator can be hard... it might be best to extract the VM 'logic' and emulate it!
