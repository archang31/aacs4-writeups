# Library Card

## Reverse Engineering -- 150 points

### Description

We have recovered a [liblibrary\_card.so](./liblibrary\_card.so) from the target. Can you reverse engineer it to recover any hidden secret information?

### Hints

* Are any functions different than the rest?
* Try cross referencing from the print\_flag function :)
* If trying to link the library with your own code, double check your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH!
