# Turtles All the Way Down

## Forensics -- 100 points

### Description

Early this morning, a breach occurred on the server hosting our next-gen drone development repository. It is your job to figure out what was taken: [challenge.zip](./challenge.zip)

### Hints

* Our analysts are using IRC to share information and investigate this breach
* Everything you need lives within these PCAP's, you simply need to carve out the relevant files
* These ZIPS appear to have been generated with 7z
* FTP is a simple text-based protocol, with passive binary streams for file transfers
