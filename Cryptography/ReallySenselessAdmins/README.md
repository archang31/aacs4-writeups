# Really Senseless Admins

## Cryptography -- 35 points

### Description

We fired Julius, but the new guy apparently misplaced the file with our pivate key. All he could find was the encrypted flag and some file labeled 'params'. [flag.enc](./flag.enc) [params.txt](./params.txt)

### Hints

* The new guy apparently just treated the flag text as a [big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Big-endian) integer. Apparently, this made it easier for him to use the online tools he had found.
* Wouldn't it be nice if there were detailed [write-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) about these cryptosystems?
* We found a few notes on the admin's desk. One note just had the URL of an online [RSA tool](https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto-highlights/rsa-step-by-step). The second note had [two](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) [URLs](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html) on it with 'plaintext ⇒ hex ⇒ int' scribbled beside it. The third one makes it look like the plaintext generated by the RSA tool will start with 104.
