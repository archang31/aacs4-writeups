# Look At The Totem

## Binary Exploitation -- 500 points

### Description

What's at the top of the Totem? Let's grab our [qemu-system-arm](./qemu-system-arm) and find out.  
Building this monolith takes a bit of time. Please allow a minute for everything to boot.

### Hints

* QEMU escapes have a lot of [research](http://www.phrack.org/papers/vm-escape-qemu-case-study.html) [online](https://vishnudevtj.github.io/notes/qemu-vm-escape-cve-2019-14378).
* QEMU is not running within KVM.
