# Stack Check Fail Fail

## Binary Exploitation -- 150 points

### Description

We've found someone's password manager connected to the network. See if you can't extract the passwords from it. Grab the server files [files.tar.gz](./files.tar.gz).

### Hints

* Stack cookies always make things harder (or do they)?
* Take a look at the implementation of \_\_stack\_chk\_fail in libc.so
* Hmm, I wonder where \_\_stack\_chk\_fail gets the name of the program from?
