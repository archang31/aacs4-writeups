# Who Does This Belong To

## Binary Exploitation -- 250 points

### Description

The authors of the newly created dius archive format have setup a web server to demonstrate it. Take a look at the website and see if you can exploit it. Remember, RCE is just the beginning.

### Hints

* The challenge server has netcat (openbsd version) installed. It might be [useful](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet).
* 'DIUS'[::-1] files are a good place to start looking. However, they are useless once they've dropped privileges. Don't worry though, there are [plenty](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/posts/2019/06/15/Privesc_Ret2libc_ASLR_64.html) [of](https://recipeforroot.com/suid-binaries/) [guides](https://lwn.net/Articles/250468/) and [examples](https://git.zx2c4.com/calibre-mount-helper-exploit/about/) on the subject.
* Did you know that libraries can have [constructor and destructor routines](http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO.html#INIT-AND-CLEANUP) too? Yeah, they're not just for classes anymore.
